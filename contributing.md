# Become a Contributor

Looking to be a contributor? Here's how you can help.

# Guidelines

Read our contributing guidelines below. They include directions for pull requests, feature requests, issues, and our coding standards.

## Pull Requests

Below is our workflow for pull requests.

1.  Visit our [GitHub repo]({{ site.repo }}).
2.  Find something you would like to work on, including anything that's loitering in the issue tracker.
3.  Fork the project and work in a topic branch.
4.  Make sure any changes you made work with {{ site.project }}.
5.  Add any content or documentation that describes the behavior you want to commit.
6.  [Rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) your branch against the `master` branch to ensure everything is up to date.
7.  Commit your changes and send a pull request.

## Feature Requests

We are not actively accepting community requests. We are, however, accepting any reproducible issues found within the {{ site.project }} core.

## Issues

Have an issue to report? [Please open a new issue]({{ site.open_issues }}). Before opening an issue, though, read our guidelines below.

### Check for fixes

Verify if your [issue has already been resolved]({{ site.closed_issues }}) before reporting an issue.

### Steps to reproduce

Providing a step-by-step repeatable procedure helps us get a fix out promptly.

### Provide testing parameters

Include any test parameters, such as your OS edition and version, what components you used, when you deployed it, etc.
