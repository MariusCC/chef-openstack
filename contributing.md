# Guidelines

Read our contributing guidelines below. They include directions for pull requests, feature requests, issues, and our coding
standards.

## Pull Requests

Below is our workflow for pull requests.

1. Visit our [GitHub repo]({{ site.repo }}).
2. Find something you would like to work on, including anything that's loitering in the issue tracker.
3. Fork the project and work in a topic branch.
4. Make sure any changes you made work with {{ site.project }}.
5. Add any content or documentation that describes the behavior you want to commit.
6. [Rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) your branch against the `master` branch to ensure everything
    is up to date.
7. Commit your changes and send a pull request.
