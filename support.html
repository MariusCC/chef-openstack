  <h2 id="definition-terms">Definitions for OpenStack Terms</h2>

  <p>The list below contains only basic terms found throughout our documentation. For a beefier, more comprehensive list, go to http://docs.openstack.org/glossary/content/glossary.html.<br />
Term  Definition<br />
A<br />
Action  Providers take idempotent actions to configure resources.<br />
Attribute  Attributes are data about nodes.<br />
Authentication  Clients authenticate to a server using pre-shared <span class="caps">RSA</span> keys and signed <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers.<br />
Auto-vivify  Internally in the library, attributes are automatically created as methods.<br />
B<br />
Bootstrap  In this context, bootstrap means to get Chef installed and ready to run on the target system.<br />
C<br />
Client  The client communicates with a server to download the cookbooks it needs to compile and run its configuration. Learn more at Chef Client.</p>

  <p>Configuration Management  Setting up all the various components and services on a server so it can fulfill a role is configuration management.<br />
Convergence  The process by which systems are brought in line with the overall configuration management policy.<br />
Cookbook  Chef cookbooks are packages for code used to configure some aspect of a system. Learn more at Cookbooks.</p>

  <p>D<br />
<span class="caps">DSL</span>  Programming or specification language dedicated to a specific problem domain. Chef makes use of meta-programming features in Ruby to create a simple <span class="caps">DSL</span> for writing recipe, role, and metadata files.<br />
Data Bag  Arbitrary store of <span class="caps">JSON</span> data that is indexed for Search. Learn more at Data Bags.</p>

  <p>Definition  Allow creation of new resource macros that string together other resources.<br />
E<br />
Environments  Provide a mechanism for managing different segmented spaces such as production, staging, development, and testing, with one Chef setup (or one organization on Hosted Chef): allowing you to set policies to dictate which versions of a given cookbook may be used within an infrastructure segment.<br />
F<br />
File Specificity  File specificity is a special order, which Chef looks for host-, platform-version- or platform-specific files to use when downloading/configuring file and template resources.<br />
G<br />
Git  Git is a distributed version control system. Learn more at Git Home Page, Pro Git Book, and GitHub&#8217;s Git reference.</p>

  <p>I<br />
Idempotent  A mathematical term that means multiple applications of the same action should not change the result.<br />
Index  Most data (all but Cookbooks) stored on the Chef Server are indexed for Search.<br />
Infrastructure  Applications run on Infrastructure. Infrastructure in this context is not physical or virtualized things like servers or networking. Rather, infrastructure is the application itself, plus all the underlying software prerequisites, server settings, tweaks, and configuration files need for it to function properly. Infrastructure typically spans nodes, and often networks.<br />
J<br />
<span class="caps">JSON</span>  JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data format that is easy to read and write. All the <span class="caps">API</span>s used in Chef are driven by <span class="caps">JSON</span> data.<br />
K<br />
Knife  A command-line tool used to work with a Chef Server and local Chef Repository. Learn more at Knife Documentation.</p>

  <p>L<br />
Library  In a Chef cookbook, a Library is arbitrary Ruby code that can be used to extend Chef&#8217;s language, or rollout new features. Learn more at Libraries.</p>

  <p>M<br />
Merb  Merb is a lightweight <span class="caps">MVC</span> framework used by the Chef Server to provide the <span class="caps">API</span> that clients communicate with. Learn more at Merb home page.</p>

  <p>Metadata  Chef cookbooks use metadata to provide hints to the Chef Server about what cookbooks should be deployed to a node, and can be used in user interfaces built on top of Chef.<br />
N<br />
Node  A node is a system that is configured in an environment. Learn more at Nodes.</p>

  <p>O<br />
Operating System  An operating system manages hardware and provides services for running application software.<br />
Organization  In Hosted Chef, an organization represents a company, department or other grouped set of servers infrastructure managed by Chef.<br />
P<br />
Platform  Chef detects the Operating System it is running on through Ohai, and uses that platform primarily to determine what provider to use for particular resources.<br />
Provider  A provider is an abstraction on top of system commands or <span class="caps">API</span> calls that is used to configure a resource. Providers are often Operating System specific, such as the provider that installs packages for Debian (<span class="caps">APT</span>), Red Hat (Yum) or ArchLinux (Pacman).<br />
Provision  The act of installing an operating system on bare metal, virtual machine or cloud computing instances is provisioning. Before Chef can configure and integrate systems, the system must first be provisioned, and then bootstrapped. This process varies by Operating System platform.<br />
Q<br />
Queue  The Chef <span class="caps">SOLR</span> search index uses a queue for incoming data that needs to be indexed for search on the Chef Server. Learn more at Search.</p>

  <p>R<br />
Recipe  A recipe is a Ruby <span class="caps">DSL</span> configuration file that you write to encapsulate resources that should be configured by Chef. Learn more at Recipes.</p>

  <p>Repository  A Chef Repository is a directory where you store all the various code used to configure your infrastructure with Chef. Learn more at Chef Repository.</p>

  <p>Resource  A resource is an abstraction that represents a particular thing that needs to be configured, such as a package or a service. Learn more at Resources and Recipes.</p>

  <p><span class="caps">REST</span>  &#8220;REpresentational State Transfer (<span class="caps">REST</span>) is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems‚Äù, commonly associated with <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. <span class="caps">API</span>s conforming to <span class="caps">REST</span> constraints are &#8220;<span class="caps">REST</span>ful&#8221;. Chef uses a <span class="caps">REST</span>ful <span class="caps">API</span>. Learn more at <span class="caps">REST</span> on Wikipedia.</p>

  <p>Role  A role describes a set of functionality for nodes through recipes and attributes. Learn more at Roles.</p>

  <p>Ruby  Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. Chef is written in Ruby and uses a number of Ruby <span class="caps">DSL</span>s for writing recipe, role, and metadata as code. Learn more at Ruby Programming Language.</p>

  <p>Run List  A run list is an array of recipes and roles that should be applied in order on the Node, or in another Role. Learn more at Nodes and Roles.</p>

  <p>S<br />
<span class="caps">SOLR</span>  <span class="caps">SOLR</span> is a full text search engine platform written in Java. Learn more at Apache <span class="caps">SOLR</span> home page.</p>

  <p>Search  Data stored by the Chef Server is indexed for Search and can be queried with <span class="caps">SOLR</span>&#8217;s Lucene search syntax. Learn more at Search.</p>

  <p>Shef  The Chef read-eval-print loop (<span class="caps">REPL</span>), Shef, is a way to run Chef in an <span class="caps">IRB</span> session. <span class="caps">IRB</span> is an interactive Ruby console. Learn more at Shef and <span class="caps">REPL</span> on Wikipedia.</p>

  <p>Solo  Chef Solo is a standalone, non-client/server way to execute Chef recipes on nodes. Learn more at Chef Solo.</p>

  <p>System Integration  The act of making disparate systems in an infrastructure work together to provide application services and business value is system integration. It is where all the systems that have been configured are brought together to do their job.<br />
T<br />
Tags  Tags are an array attribute of nodes. Learn more at Tags.</p>

  <p>Template  Chef uses <span class="caps">ERB</span> templates to create dynamically generated configuration files. The template files themselves are stored in cookbooks and generated using the Erubis library as it is faster than the default implementation of <span class="caps">ERB</span> in the Ruby standard library.<br />
U<br />
User  In the Open Source Chef Server, users log into the Webui Management Console. In the Hosted Chef, users are credentialed entities used by humans to connect to Hosted Chef to manage the Organization.<br />
W<br />
Webui  Hosted Chef and the Open Source Chef Server have a web user interface Management Console that can be used to view and modify various parts of the environment. Learn more at Management Console.</p>
