# Unveil

"Unveil" is a GitHub Page made using [Bootstrap CSS](http://getboostrap.com), [Mixture](http://mixture.io), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It is a minimal way to create static webpages and publish them on GitHub.

Unveil is [CCPL-licensed](https://github.com/softlayer/chef-openstack/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE) and free to use.

## Before Starting

To harness all the power behind this theme, you need to install Ruby and Jekyll (a Ruby gem). However, you do not have to install either to make your own page. By making just a few changes to the `_config.yml` file, you can create a page in minutes. See the "Configure" section below.

Of course, should you prefer to eat your own dog food, keep reading.
