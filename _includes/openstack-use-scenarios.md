# **OpenStack Use Scenarios**

OpenStack is a cloud-computing project. It allows the implementer to create a private datacenter and provides everything needed for a private cloud experience:

* Virtual Machines/Instances
* Block Storage
* Networking 

While it's very time-consuming to set up manually on your own, our Chef recipes make it simple to get up and running quickly. As an example, let's look at fictional company called SoftCube.

# SoftCube

SoftCube is a new startup. They expect a large boom in new customers and need the ability to adjust quickly to a changing set of requirements. Using a private cloud will provide them with the flexibility and adaptability that they need. To make this happen, SoftCube needs to move three of their existing hardware servers to the cloud. Currently, they have two web servers and one database server.

These servers reside on-site and neither of them have redundant power or networking. Let's get them moved to the SoftLayer Private Cloud that SoftCube just decided to purchase.

SoftCube will need OpenStack compute instances to replace their hardware servers. SoftCube is a security-conscious company, they will use key-based SSH authentication to access their compute instancesâ€”the default behavior for new compute instances in OpenStack. But, before creating these instances, we'll need to create the SSH key that will be used to access them. Then, each time SoftCube creates a new instance, OpenStack can inject the SSH key, and they'll use the key each time they need to log in to one of their servers.

## Create an SSH Key
To create an SSH key, you'll follow these simple steps in the Horizon dashboard.

1. Log in to the Horizon dashboard running on SoftCube's new SoftLayer Private Cloud.
2. Click on the "Project" tab.
3. Select your Current Project (admin in this case).
4. Click "Access & Security".
5. Click the "Keypairs" tab.
6. Click "Create Keypair".
7. Name the new keypair "SoftCube-Admin" and click the blue "Create Keypair" button.
8. Now that the keypair is created, download it by clicking the provided link if it does not start automatically.

## Create Compute Instances

Now that SoftCube's keypair is available, the compute instances can be created.

1. Click on the "Project" tab.
2. Select your Current Project (admin in this case).
3. Click "Instances".
4. Click the "Launch Instances" button.
5. A new dialog window will appear with all the details needed for launching a new compute instance. In the launch instance window, they will need the following information handy to create and launch their instances: (1) Image type, (2) Name, (3) Flavor, (4) Keypair, and (5) Network information. Additional volume and post-creation options may be needed in SoftCube's future, but are not necessary to specify right now.
6. On the "Details" tab, provide these options.

	* Instance Source: Image<br>
	* Image: Ubuntu 12.04 Server (Cloud) amd64<br>
	* Instance Name: web1.softcube.com<br>
	* Flavor: m1.medium<br>

7. Click on the "Access & Security" tab.

	* "SoftCube-Admin" should be already selected as the SSH key, but if not, select it from the list.<br>
	* Uncheck the "default" security group.<br>
	* Check the "basic-ssh-icmp" security group.<br>


### Configure Network Access

SoftCube's web servers will need both internet access and private network access with each other. They've decided to use floating IPs in OpenStack to handle inbound public access to their web servers, private network access for all three servers, and no public network access to their database server. This network setup requires each web server to have two network connections, as illustrated below.

1. Click on the "Networking" tab. 
2. In the "Available Networks" list, click the "+" button next to "stack-network" and "softlayer-private".
3. Click the "Launch" button. The first web server will be launched. Since SoftCube needs two web servers, follow the same steps to create a second web server with the name web2.softcube.com.
4. Lastly, they'll need an instance for the database server. Since SoftCube wants to plan for growth as early as possible, they will tweak a few changes to the instance configuration.
5. On the "Details" tab, provide these options: 

	> * Instance name: db.softcube.com 
	> * Flavor: m1.large (for a beefier amount of compute power) 

6. On the "Access & Security" tab, provide the same options as your web server.
7. On the "Networking" tab under "Available Networks", click the "+" button next to "softlayer-private".
8. Click the "Launch" button. Within seconds, the database instance will launch, and SoftCube will be on the private cloud!


### Allocate Public IP Addresses

We're getting closer, but we aren't quite finished yet. Each web server will need a public IP for inbound public access. Currently, the compute instances are only accessible via the devices connected to OpenStack Quantum/Neutron network, or any device that is on the SoftLayer Private Network. SoftCube can allocate public IP addresses purchased from SoftLayer to any instance at any time by assigning Floating IPs, which is our next step.

1. From the Instances list, click the "More" dropdown for web1.softcube.com.
2. Click "Associate Floating IP".
3. Currently SoftCube has no allocated Floating IPs. One will need to be allocated before it will before it can be assigned to a compute instance. Click the "+" button to associate a floating IP with the current project.
4. We need floating IPs provided to us from the "softlayer-public" network, so ensure it is selected as the Pool, and click the "Allocate IP" button.
5. The Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box will appear with a public IP address pre-populated. Ensure the web1.softcube.com server is selected as well, and click "Associate".
6. Horizon will attach the new public IP address to the web1.softcube.com instance, and display it in the "IP Address" column in the instances list. Sometimes this may take a moment to update, but by this time the IP address has already been routed to the instance.
7. Follow the same steps above to allocate another floating IP address to web2.softcube.com. 

SoftCube now has three OpenStack compute instances:

* Two web servers with public inbound access
* One database server that is accessible only on the backend 

At this point, they can start transitioning their aging, hardware-based web and database servers to their new OpenStack instances.

Looks like SoftCube is well on its way to a successful future in the private cloud.
