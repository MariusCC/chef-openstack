  <h1 id="welcome">Your Contributions are Welcome</h1>

  <p>Looking to be a contributor? Here&#8217;s how you can help.</p>

  <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>

  <p>Read our contributing guidelines below. They include directions for pull requests, feature requests, issues, and our coding standards.</p>

  <h2 id="pulls">Pull Requests</h2>

  <p>Below is our workflow for pull requests.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>After you find something you would like to work on, which includes anything loitering in the issue tracker, fork the project and work in a topic branch.</li>
    <li>Make sure any changes you made work with {{ site.projects }}.</li>
    <li>Add any content or documentation that describes the behavior you want to commit.</li>
    <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">Rebase</a> your branch against the `master` branch to ensure everything is up to date.</li>
    <li>Commit your changes and send a pull request.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="standards">Coding Standards</h2>

  <p>We appreciate the use of professional code quality standards. In addition, we recommend keeping your code simple and clean by not polluting your pull request with unintended changes.</p>

  <p>In addition, editor preferences are available in the .editorconfig file for use with most text editors. Plugins are available at <a href="http://editorconfig.org/#download">http://editorconfig.org</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="features">Feature Requests</h2>

  <p>We are not actively accepting community requests. We are, however, accepting any reproducible issues found within the {{ site.projects }} core.</p>

  <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

  <p>Have an issue to report? <a href="http://github.com/softlayer/chef-openstack/issues">Please open a new issue</a>. Before opening an issue, though, read our guidelines below.</p>

  <h4>1. Check for fixes</h4>

  <p>Verify if your <a href="http://github.com/softlayer/chef-openstack/issues?milestone=1&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">issue has already been resolved</a> before reporting an issue.</p>

  <h4>2. Steps to reproduce</h4>

  <p>Providing a step-by-step repeatable procedure helps us get a fix out promptly.</p>

  <h4>3. Provide testing parameters</h4>

  <p>Include any test parameters, such as your OS edition and version, what components you used, when you deployed it, etc.</p>
