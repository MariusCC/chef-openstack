  <li>Fork the project and work in a topic branch.</li>
  <li>Make sure any changes you made work with {{ site.project }}.</li>
  <li>Add any content or documentation that describes the behavior you want to commit.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase" target="_blank">Rebase</a> your branch against the <code>master</code> branch to ensure everything

<h1 id="features">Feature Requests</h1>

    <p>We are not actively accepting community requests. We are, however, accepting any reproducible issues found within the {{ site.project }} core.</p>

<h1 id="issues">Issues</h1>

    <p>Have an issue to report? <a href="{{ site.open_issues }}" target="_blank">Please open a new issue</a>. Before opening an issue, though, read our guidelines below.</p>

    <h3>Check for fixes</h3>

    <p>Verify if your <a href="{{ site.closed_issues }}" target="_blank">issue has already been resolved</a> before reporting an issue.</p>

    <h3>Steps to reproduce</h3>

    <p>Providing a step-by-step repeatable procedure helps us get a fix out promptly.</p>

    <h3>Provide testing parameters</h3>

    <p>Include any test parameters, such as your OS edition and version, what components you used, when you deployed it, etc.</p>
