      <li>Make sure any changes you made work with {{ site.project }}.</li>
      <li>Add any content or documentation that describes the behavior you want to commit.</li>
      <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">Rebase</a> your branch against the `master` branch to ensure everything is up to date.</li>
      <li>Commit your changes and send a pull request.</li>

    <h3>Steps to reproduce</h3>
