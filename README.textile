h1. GitHub Page: Chef-OpenStack

Our GitHub Page for Chef-OpenStack is a branded theme made using "Bootstrap CSS":http://getboostrap.com and served up by Jekyll. It is a minimal way to create static landing pages for each repo and publish them on our GitHub Pages.

h2. Before Starting

To harness all the power behind this theme, you need to install Ruby and Jekyll (a Ruby gem). However, you do not have to install either to make your own page. By making just a few changes to the @_config.yml@ file, you can "create a page on-the-fly in minutes":#configuration.

Of course, should you prefer to eat your own dog food, keep reading.
