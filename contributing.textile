h1(#welcome). Your Contributions are Welcome

Looking to be a contributor? Here's how you can help.

h2(#guidelines). Guidelines

Read our contributing guidelines below. They include directions for pull requests, feature requests, issues, and our coding standards.

h2(#pulls). Pull Requests

Below is our workflow for pull requests.

# After you find something you would like to work on, which includes anything loitering in the issue tracker, fork the project and work in a topic branch.
# Make sure any changes you made work with {{ site.projects }}.
# Add any content or documentation that describes the behavior you want to commit.
# "Rebase":https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase your branch against the `master` branch to ensure everything is up to date.
# Commit your changes and send a pull request.

h2(#standards). Coding Standards

We appreciate the use of professional code quality standards. In addition, we recommend keeping your code simple and clean by not polluting your pull request with unintended changes.

In addition, editor preferences are available in the .editorconfig file for use with most text editors. Plugins are available at "http://editorconfig.org":http://editorconfig.org/#download.
